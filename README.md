learning-languages
===================

I believe the title to be self evident, but I'll be more explicit. The code here is likely not useful for anyone, nor is it good code. This is just where I'm going to store code samples for when I'm learning languages or trying to test out language features.

Ideally this can become a place that I can refer back to in case I wanted to review a language feature, but if it helps others, great. Ultimately this is for my personal betterment.

If it helps you out, enjoy.
